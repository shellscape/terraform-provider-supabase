# supabase_storage_buckets (Data Source)

Retrieves a list of storage buckets for a Supabase project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "supabase_storage_buckets" "all" {
  project_ref = "abcdefghijklmnopqrst"
}

# Access individual buckets from the list
output "bucket_names" {
  value = [for bucket in data.supabase_storage_buckets.all.buckets : bucket.name]
}

# Find a specific bucket by name
locals {
  images_bucket = [for bucket in data.supabase_storage_buckets.all.buckets : bucket if bucket.name == "images"]
}

output "images_bucket_public" {
  value = length(local.images_bucket) > 0 ? local.images_bucket[0].public : null
}
```

## Notes

- Storage bucket creation and management is typically done through the Supabase Dashboard or Storage API directly
- Bucket policies and RLS (Row Level Security) settings are managed separately through database policies
